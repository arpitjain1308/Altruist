**** Round 1 ****
We are making a web portal where we students can post their projects and share the details about the project with some images of it.
This helps different students of same interest to know about different projects and get help about the same.
In this, we are also adding community on the basis of the universities or colleges.
We have used a black green theme for better looking user interface (UI).
Till now, we have created home page along with the navigation bar and the project posting page.

**** Round 2 ****
Now, we have made User Interface more interactive by adding running video in background.
Also, modified project posting page.

Further progress will be updated.................
